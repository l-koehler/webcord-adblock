# Effects

This CSS Theme hides:

* Discords Nitro Ads  
* Emojis/Stickers you can't use without Nitro  
* The option to boost Servers  
* HypeSquad/Nitro Badges in User Profiles  
* Custom Avatar Decorations (these mildly obnoxious profile animations)  
* the "Send Gift" button  

If you additionally use the `add-strict.theme.css` file, it will also  
hide "User Activity", which is mostly advertising spotify or some game,  
and hide nitro users profile gradients*.  
*: It still shows the profile theme as light mode  
if the users profile page has a light theme.
